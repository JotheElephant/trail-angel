### For hikers of all ages, find hikes near you.  Break new trails, create new memories and share with your friends. ###
   

## Summary ##
  Trail Angel supplies information for specific trails near you and provides the weather and mapping data you need for a fun and safe adventure.  Day or night, you can find your perfect trail and predict how long it will take you to return.  Weather and mapping data give you all the tools you need to stay safe and plan accordingly.  Trail Angel even allows you to go off the beaten path and record the geolocation of your journey.  Add photos to specific locations of your trek and upload for other hikers to enjoy.

## Problem ##
  It's often difficult to predict how long it will take for an out-and-back dayhike.  Will you get caught in the dark?  You know the trail is 5 miles each way, but how much will the elevation gain slow you down?  When does the sun set?  What will the weather bring?  What do other hikers think of this trail?  What if you want to record your off-trail trek with GPS accuracy and refer to it later?  

## Solution ##
  Trail Angel opens up a world of possibilities to discover and share new adventures.  It provides an estimate for hike time based on distance and terrain, continuously refining based on your pace.  The app keeps you up to date with the latest weather information for your region and alert you based on possible risks like thunderstorms and nightfall.  Trail Angel shows you the best trails in your area based on community ratings.  It even allows you to record and submit your own custom trail, complete with location-based photos, and upload the adventure for others to follow.
